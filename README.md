Graphical bulk picture resize tool written in Racket.


# About

This app is meant to be a alternative to https://bulkresizephotos.com
A member of my family was using that service to resize their photos
so I thought I would write a libre replacement.


# Bugs

Report bugs to [the upstream on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/xgqt/rbulkresizer).

- few TODOs and FIXMEs here and there
- can only create PNG images


# Compilation

**WARNING!!!** This process is still experimental.
Better to just install [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/download/), especially if you are on GNU+Linux.

By using scripts from this repository the binaries can be found
in [bin](./bin) directory.


## Linux

Execute `make exe`.


## Windows

Run the [exe.ps1](./exe.ps1) script.
