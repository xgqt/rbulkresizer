Graphical bulk picture resize tool written in Racket.


# About

This app is meant to be a alternative to https://bulkresizephotos.com
A memeber of my family was using that service to resize their photos
so I thought I would write a libre replacement.


# Bugs

- few TODOs and FIXMEs here and there
- can only create PNG images
